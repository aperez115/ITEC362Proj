          The EyeToy was an accessory released for the PS2 back in 2003. It was a motion-controlled camera that would 
          plug into the ps2 as a usb connection, allowing the player's body to essentially become the controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          It worked by detecting movements through the camera and making it work for a specific game. The user could move their 
          bodies to interact with objects and actions in the games that they could play. The EyeToy also had a built-in microphone, 
          allowing for voice commands to be implemented into certain games. It was usually used in party games and had more of a 
          casual audience.

          The PlayStation VR was Sony's first step into Virtual Reality gaming. This accessory was first released back in 
          2016 for the PS4. Functioning as a headset, it allowed players to immerse themselves in virtual worlds, bringing 
          the action right to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the introduction of the PlayStation Move controllers that came with the VR headset, it helped to act as the player's 
          virtual hands and made interacting with objects in-game even more immersive.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The PS VR paved the way for the next generation of VR hardware in Sony's gaming industry, as the PSVR2 would be 
          released later for the PS5.

          The PlayStation camera is a motion-detection device that allows players to better interact with their consoles. 
          You can think of this accessory as the true successor to the EyeToy, as it has improved in every way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The camera has built-in microphones used for recording audio and for voice recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          This accessory was widely used for live-streaming and recording videos with face cams. This would allow the player 
          to record their face and put it into a video of them playing a game, getting their live reactions.
